# NicerApp
this is a revolutionary and constantly evolving, well-maintained repository of HTML, CSS, JS and PHP code with which you can build websites that use a tiled image, photo or youtube video as site background for information and apps that are put over that background in a semi-transparent way.

# Installation - overview for curious young professionals
Nicerapp can be run on windows, linux and macOS systems, possibly even on smartphones,
and all it requires is a webserver that can serve up PHP scripts,
and the **couchdb database server[0]** which works with **JSON data**.

However, it can be augmented with a **SQL server** like mysql or postgresql[1] **which puts data in tables, rows and columns**.

[0] see https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/index.html

[1] see https://adodb.org

The default database for nicerapp is couchdb. I find it more flexible and a lot easier to use than SQL data.

The couchdb server software and it's instructions can be found on https://couchdb.apache.org

Regardless of what mix-up of database servers that you use for your site, 
one guiding principle of developing web-apps with nicerapp is that we shield our database servers from the outside world as much as possible.

This means all requests for data by the browsers go via the **browser's jQuery.com** (.../nicerapp_v2/nicerapp/3rd-party/jQuery) **AJAX** (asynchronous javascript and XML) code **to PHP scripts** that are all specific to the requested functionality, **and from there to the actual database server** and back to PHP and finally to the **browser**, which in non-debug mode **gets back only FAILED or SUCCESS (or the requested data)**.
All error handling, database sanity, and cleanliness code is in the PHP scripts and the PHP libraries[2] used to access the database.

couchdb : https://github.com/nicerapp/sag

please note : to update the cookie timeout length for couchdb to 1 week (measured in seconds), you have to enter the following command on the linux commandline :
>  curl http://admin:validpass@192.168.178.xyz:5984/_node/_local/_config/couch_httpd_auth/timeout -X PUT -d '"604800"'

# Installation 

On Windows(tm)(r), the https://wampserver.com/en WAMP stack (windows, apache, mysql, php) is well-suited, 

and it can also be done on **linux systems[3]** from the **terminal** OS-level app, as such :

> sudo su -
> 
> apt update
> 
> apt upgrade
> 
> apt dist-upgrade
> 
> apt install -y composer apache2 php php-dev libapache2-mod-php php7.4-mbstring php-imap curl php-curl php-mailparse curl git imagemagick npm net-tools python-chardet apt-transport-https gnupg wordnet
> 
> a2enmod headers rewrite
> 
> curl https://couchdb.apache.org/repo/keys.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/couchdb-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null 2>&1
source /etc/os-release
>
> echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/couchdb-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apache.jfrog.io/artifactory/couchdb-deb/ ${VERSION_CODENAME} main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/couchdb.list >/dev/null
>    
> apt update 
> 
> apt install couchdb
> 
> npm install -g add-cors-to-couchdb
> 
> add-cors-to-couchdb -u admin -p YOURADMINPASSWORDFORCOUCHDB

[3] if you have no linux system yet, know that a core-i5 with a modest amount of RAM and SSD space runs the latest version just fine, and i recommend to install https://ubuntu.com or kubuntu in case you want semi-transparent windows in your OS

# setting up the OS startup and daily maintenance scripts

put the following in /etc/rc.local :
> #!/bin/bash
> 
> /var/www/nicerapp/restart_allApps.sh &

then execute the following command in the ubuntu terminal app :
> sudo chmod a+x /etc/rc.local

put the following in /etc/cron.daily/nicerapp.sh :
> #!/bin/bash

> /var/www/nicerapp/restart_app_imageSearchCrawler.sh &

then execute the following command in the ubuntu terminal app :
> sudo chmod a+x /etc/cron.daily/nicerapp.sh

# setting up the apache web server

copy the following into /etc/apache2/sites-available/001.localhost.conf 
(everything *between* the /---- lines, so not including those two lines)
(be sure to modify ServerAdmin)
(this particular server is running on the unencrypted port 80, port 443 is the encrypted SSL port but it requires more configuration effort, see the manuals for **letsencrypt** and **certbot** and the example further down on this page you're reading now)

````
/----
<VirtualHost *:80>
	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
	ServerName localhost

	ServerAdmin rv.nicer.app@gmail.com
	DocumentRoot /var/www/nicerapp

	# Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
	# error, crit, alert, emerg.
	# It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
	# modules, e.g.
	#LogLevel info ssl:warn

	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.localhost.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.localhost.log combined

	# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
	# enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
	# include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
	# following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
	# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
	#Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
	<Directory /var/www/nicerapp>
		AllowOverride All
		Require all granted
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
/----
````

after that, you can enable the site with :

>sudo a2ensite 001-localhost.conf
>	
>sudo service apache2 restart

you must then initialize the proper file permissions :
> chmod a+x /var/www/nicerapp/setPermissions.sh
> 
> /var/www/nicerapp/setPermissions.sh

when that completes, you can point your web-browser to http://localhost

# Adding background image files
The backgrounds are stored under 
.../nicerapp/siteMedia/backgrounds/landscape, 
.../nicerapp/siteMedia/backgrounds/tiled, 
and .../nicerapp/siteMedia/backgrounds/iframe/youtube (as *.txt files containing only one youtube video URL each)

These backgrounds are not included with the distribution of nicerapp, otherwise i'd run out of storage space on github.

# serving the site from an encrypted setup using HTTPS:// (SSL)
	
> sudo apt install nginx letsencrypt certbot
	
https://nginx.com is a gateway server, which you can put in front of your webserver software and database servers.
We need it to serve database connections over SSL connections, and to be able to serve multiple domain names (nicer.app, zoned.at, said.by, etc) from just one outgoing aka public IP address.

Next : put the following code snippet as a template in **/etc/nginx/sites-available/00-default-ssl.conf**
After that : 
> sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/na-default-ssl.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/na-default-ssl.conf

**don't forget : you need to tell apache to run on the right ports, 
which are 444, 447 and 448 in this example case, 
and those ports should NOT be forwarded from your modem / ADSL router / fiber internet connection device to your LAN. 
port 80 should be disabled in all files in /etc/apache2/sites-available/, by modifying the line(s) containing 'VirtualHost'**

**edit /etc/apache2/ports.conf** to become the following, but be sure to change 192.168.178.77 your server's LAN IP address, which can be found with the 'ifconfig' terminal app :
````
<IfModule ssl_module>
        Listen 192.168.178.77:444
        Listen 192.168.178.77:447

**Finally**, you need to create the actual encryption keys for apache2.
This is free and fairly simple.
You can choose between **certbot** or **letsencrypt**.
You can find tutorials on how to use them via google searches for either 'certbot example' or 'letsencrypt example'.

After that, the only remaining step is to restart all the server software :
> sudo service couchdb restart
> 
> sudo service apache2 restart
> 
> sudo service nginx restart
	
# Modifying the HTML for a nicerapp site
This is done by modifying .../nicerapp/domainConfigs/YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/index.template.php
and .../nicerapp/domainConfigs/YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/desktop.source.js

# Adding new URLs and apps into a nicerapp site
All apps and pages on a nicerapp site are loaded through a URL that looks somewhat like this :
http://localhost/apps/eyJtdXNpYyI6eyJzZXQiOiJpbmRleCJ9fQ

You will notice the "strange" sequence after /apps/ in that URL.
It's strange because it's base64-encoded JSON, allowing for multiple settings to be passed into the nicerapp PHP code, while avoiding the "old" practice of using http://localhost/apps/someApp.php?setting1=x&setting2=y

If you want to simplify things for use in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), you can have http://localhost/abc automatically translated into http://localhost/apps/eyJtdXNpYyI6eyJzZXQiOiJpbmRleCJ9fQ in **.../.htaccess** - there are already some examples supplied.

You would store any new apps that you might create under .../nicerapp/apps/YOURNAME/APPNAME/app.dialog.siteContent.php or .../nicerapp/apps/YOURNAME/APPNAME/app.dialog.siteToolbarLeft.php or any other main DIV name with class="vividDialog" as found in .../nicerapp/domainConfigs/YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/index.template.php

And .../ajax_get_content.php is responsible for mapping your http://localhost/apps/eyJtdXNpYyI6eyJzZXQiOiJpbmRleCJ9fQ to the right code.

One would ask, rightfully so, how to create these /apps/* URLs.
in PHP, that's done with the always available .../nicerapp/functions.php::**base64_encode_url()** and .../nicerapp/functions.php::**base64_decode_url()**
in JavaScript, it's done with the always available **na.m.base64_encode_url()** and **na.m.base64_decode_url()**

# Window Cosmetics Settings
2021/07/20 : 
it needs more work. it needs theme capabilities for instance.
and please note i may run a different ubuntu OS installation on my development machine, with it's own apache2 running on localhost only of course, but that this machine does query the live server.

so if i'm working on my development machine (which is just good practice) and go from debugging general issues to specifically hunt for WCS settings,
then i'm updating the live server with the new graphics settings.

to try to copy such settings from a development couchdb to a live-server couchdb,
is to invite tons upon tons of extra work, which will sometimes be nearly impossible to replicate accurately.

# Questions, bug-reports, feature-requests?
you can post these to rene.veerman.netherlands@gmail.com, and i will try to respond within 72 hours, even on weekends.

if you need a quick solution towards getting yourself a collection of background images, you can look for 'wallpaper' on https://rarbg.to and use a torrent client (like transmission on ubuntu, or utorrent on windows) to download them.

i will consider making the 15GB of photos and tiled images that is currently served on https://nicer.app available on https://rarbg.to
