<b>2025-10-27-Monday 08:39CET</b> : I've given my future career as software architect ample thought, and I've always been trapped between the desire to get rich (from very modest financial origins), and being of great use to humanity (by producing free software for the rest of my life, as well as be active as an assertive peace activist).<br/>
But today, the coin finally dropped. Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux, is reportedly (and if I'm not mistaken) "worth" over 1-hundred million USD.
And I can *probably* achieve at least the same, even if I do keep maintaining and expanding this Software, believe it or not (I don't care if you do right now).<br/>
But what's more important is that I have a stable income from a true-medical-reasons welfare disability pension already; and that I can live within my means.<br/>
I'm also not into luxury goods, aside from my digital gear.<br/>
<b>So I'm doing it. Building MIT licensed software for the rest of my life.</b>
