                Gross profits for these music pages will be shared 34% to the Owner of NicerApp WebOS, and 66% to legitimate copyright claim holders per calendar year (payable 10th of January each year), subject to the amount of seconds that their music was played in total (so for any IP, for any hour on any day) relative to the amount of seconds of total playlength for any and all music that is under such a given verified legitimate copyright claim for that calendar year.
