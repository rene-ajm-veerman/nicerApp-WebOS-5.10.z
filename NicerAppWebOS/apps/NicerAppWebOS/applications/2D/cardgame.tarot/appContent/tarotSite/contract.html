<h1><span style="color:red;background:white;">nicerEnterprises_tarot Profit Sharing Contract</span></h1>

<p>
	This is a contract between the creator and owner of the website nicerEnterprises_tarot, and the holder of Copyright or Intellectual Property rights for artwork and text ("IP holder") found on the website nicerEnterprises_tarot.info<br/>
	The URLs for nicerEnterprises_tarot are:
	<ul>
		<li>"live site" : http://nicerEnterprises_tarot.com</li>
	</ul>
	This contract is made under Dutch law, because [the owner of nicerEnterprises_tarot.com] lives in The Netherlands.<br/>
</p>

<p>
The Intellectual Property found on nicerEnterprises_tarot can be divided into 2 categories; "Decks" and "Descriptions".<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Decks are the entire set of artwork that makes up a Tarot card set, and for which the URL starts with http://nicerEnterprises_tarot.com/decks/ or http://skatescene.biz/sites/nicerEnterprises_tarot.com/decks/, and ends with: .jpg</li>
	<li>Descriptions are the entire set of text that describes the cards 0 through 77 in a Tarot card deck, and all the reading types offered on nicerEnterprises_tarot. Currently only 1 Description set is used, written by [the owner of nicerEnterprises_tarot.com].</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In return for allowing [the owner of nicerEnterprises_tarot.com] to host and use their Intellectual Property on nicerEnterprises_tarot, the IP holder will receive a share of profits, that is determined as follows;<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Of the entire annual profits of nicerEnterprises_tarot, a 50% share is reserved for IP holders other than [the owner of nicerEnterprises_tarot.com]. This 50% share is then divided as follows;
		<ul>
			<li>25% of total annual profits is divided into "deck play shares" by the number of Tarot games played on nicerEnterprises_tarot, but only those games that played decks that IP holders other than [the owner of nicerEnterprises_tarot.com] have signed this contract for ("signed decks").<br/>
			For each signed deck, the number of times that deck has been played determines how many "deck play shares" are paid out to the IP holder of that deck.
			</li>
			<li>25% of total annual profits is reserved for IP holders other than [the owner of nicerEnterprises_tarot.com] who have signed this contract, that hold the copyrights to Descriptions.<br/>
			This share is once again divided (into "description play shares") by the number of Tarot games played on nicerEnterprises_tarot for which the descriptions come from an IP holder that has signed this contract.<br/>
			The IP holder for any description will receive as many description play shares as there were Tarot games played on nicerEnterprises_tarot using descriptions owned by the IP holder.<br/>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Profits of nicerEnterprises_tarot are calculated from January 1st up to and including December 31st, paid out no later than February 1st.</li>
	<li>Once an IP holder is signed, he/she/they will receive profits of the entire calendar year in which they first applied to sign on, as per terms stipulated in the previous bullet item.</li>
	<li>If no decks have signed IP holders, then the entire 50% share of annual profits of nicerEnterprises_tarot is awarded to IP holders of descriptions, per the same division as is described above for half that amount.</li>
	<li>If no descriptions have signed IP holders, then the entire 50% share of annual profits of nicerEnterprises_tarot is awarded to IP holders of decks, per the same division as is described above for half that amount.</li>
	<li>If no decks and no descriptions have signed IP holders by January 1st, [the owner of nicerEnterprises_tarot.com] can keep the entire profits for the previous year.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Signed IP holders will be provided with as much digital proof as is humanly possible by [the owner of nicerEnterprises_tarot.com] to calculate the actual play counts and what-was-played on nicerEnterprises_tarot.
</p>

<p>
Signed IP holders have the right to request read-only FTP access to both the development site section for nicerEnterprises_tarot, and for it's live site.<br/>
Before receiving such access, they must first physically sign and mail a non-disclosure agreement that gives 1 technical expert from the IP holder's Company or 1 technical expert hired by the IP holder (if not signed on behalf of a Company), or the IP holder signer him/herself, the right to view the files that make up nicerEnterprises_tarot. At no time is the IP holder or technical expert allowed to make, keep or any any way use a copy of any of the files that make up nicerEnterprises_tarot, other than to determine if the statistics [the owner of nicerEnterprises_tarot.com] reports are accurate.
</p>

<p>
IP holders are allowed and encouraged to promote their own Decks and Descriptions by advertising the proper URL (only under http://nicerEnterprises_tarot.com/ please, as that is the live, non-experimentation version of the site).
</p>
