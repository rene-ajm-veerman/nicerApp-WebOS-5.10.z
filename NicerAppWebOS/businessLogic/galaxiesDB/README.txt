So what will this be?

A multi-dimensional, indexable, 3D way to address databases of all sorts on all platforms.
Currently only supporting CouchDB on *.deb dpkg capable Linux Servers.

Whereas a filesystem is a tree without an actual root system until you plug in a backup harddisk and mount it,
SpheresDB will address all of these particular issues
(loadsharing, loadbalancing, geographical vicinity of data, etc, etc)
and by doing that will turn a NicerApp WebOS into a true YouTube and Google Docs level Operating System for the web.

Other Big-Tech companies needed whole flocks of teams to do this, I believe I can do this as a single man team. :)
