\nmy software engineering jobs are my day-jobs.
\nmy peace activism in the form of preventing wars and climate disasters favors a multi-polar view in which both democracy and communist/socialist
\nforms of government have an equal right to do business on Earth.
\n
\nin my view, the world has not changed much since the time of the ancient empires and kings ruling small or larger patches of land.
\ntoday, we see in the western world a strong alliance between the business leaders and politicians,
\nand in the eastern (communist) parts of the world a similar pattern, but one using a different name for business leader or leader of a country.
\n
\nwhat we do have improved since ancient times, is technology.
\nwe have ships, trains, roads, aircraft, TV, radio, mass-media, and the internet, to name a few.
\nand especially the internet gives hope for honest political debate (happening in 2001 to 2024 usually in it's best forms on non-biased forums),
\nwhich can then be filtered into the output of mass media (to an extent that the ruling class (kings, presidents, and business leaders) allow it.
