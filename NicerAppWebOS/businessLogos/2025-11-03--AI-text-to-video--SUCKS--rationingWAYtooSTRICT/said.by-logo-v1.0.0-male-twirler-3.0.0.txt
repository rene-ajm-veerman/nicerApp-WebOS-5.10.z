A vibrant 3D animated city park on a sunny Saturday afternoon, golden hour light, hyper-realistic Pixar style. Wide establishing shot slowly dolly-zooming forward (12-second loop):

- Lush green lawn with dappled sunlight through oak trees, followed by a huge non-linear edged lake lined with trees and shrubs, followed by highrises and a train and bus station in the distance.

- A diverse crowd of 20-somethings and families:

 - Joggers in white-blue neon sneakers

 - A male white shorthaired street performer twirling with wing chung and bagua circle step footwork with 2 clearly visible ropes each ending with burning material, at a slow pace, so the bits of burning material are distinguishable compared to the pace of the joggers and people enjoying their day there.

 - A food truck with a line (tacos + ice cream)

 - Kids chasing bubbles from a bubble machine

 - A small gathering of people in the distance doing tai-chi quan practice
