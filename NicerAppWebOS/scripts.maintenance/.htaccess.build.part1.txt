        # it's not a facebook post, and it's not a forum thread either. not even a nested forum thread.
        # it's just text, photo, audio and video data ranging from tweet sized to gigabytes sized,
        # that's gotta get edited very efficiently
        # and displayed fast and correctly each time,
        # in a very, eh, diverse range of circumstances.
        #
        # NicerApp again works in a very simple way,
        # with one 'dataID' pointing to all content and data related to a 'post',
        # as structured (recently or not) by it's author and the 'commenters' to that 'post'.
        # (to speak in facebook terminology, for lack of a better set of analogies).
        #
        # i could start speaking in my own marketing choice terminology about my products and services,
        # but i'd really like to avoid that and help create an industry standard of at least
        # what to call things that one posts or says online.
        #
        # dataIDs and viewIDs are formed inside the server (at random) upon creation of the 'post' or 'view',
        # (of text data, a photo-album, or even an entire 2D and/or 3D webpage filled with people and data),
        # trying low counts of random characters first each time,
        # and then slowly increasing the number of characters used to create a new dataID
        # when what's being tried is again already found in the database on the server.
        #
        # a dataID points to a JSON record containing not just theme settings for new viewers
        # to that post's data, along with possibly also *other* dataIDs,
        # which often leads NicerApp to possibly pull in content from there as well[1],
        # to arrive at a final 2D and/or 3D view in the browser.
        #
        # a dataID points to JSON records in the '{$myDomainName}___data_by_users' table,
        # and those records have a structure like this :
            #
            #### someone's post :
            #
            # "username" : "Guest",
            # "dataID" : "csB",
            # "view" : "{$aViewID}",
            # "appParameters" : [
            #     {
            #         "{$someAppName}" : {
            #             "someApp_param_1_keyName" : "someApp_param_1_value"
            #         ",
            #         ...
            #     },
            #     .....
            # ],
            # "theme" : { ... }
            #
            #
            #### someone's comment to another person's post :
            #
            # "username" : "Rene AJM Veerman",
            # "dataID" : "cAsD",
            # "view" : "{$aViewID}",
            # "appParameters" : [
            #     {
            #         "{$someAppName}" : {
            #             "dataID" : "{$dataID}" # the dataID of the post being replied to.
            #         ",
            #         ...
            #     },
            #     .....

            # "theme" : { ... }
            #


                # the viewID points to a record in the '{$myDomainName}___views' table,
                # with a viewID pointing to a JSON record that is structured like a piece of JSON
                # directly derived from a 'view record' as listed in :
                    #
                    #   .../NicerAppWebOS/domainConfigs/nicer.app/mainmenu.items.php:
                    #       $na_apps_structure[...]['apps-current']['NicerApp-WebOS__pageSettings'],
                    #
                # but with that piece of JSON able to udergo (1) a string replacement procedure from data/parameters
                # that can be found in 'viewParameters_initial' upon rendering into the browser,
                # and (2), a file-inclusion mechanism like PHP's require_once(), to prevent databases from getting filled
                # with field values that are larger than the underlying database server manufacturer supports.

                # the theme settings are listed in a field with name 'theme', which contains data like what's
                # defined in and returned by the function
                # .../NicerAppWebOS/logic.business/class.core.WebsiteOperatingSystem-5.y.z.php::getPageCSS()
                # but which is to be overlayed *on top* of the data provided that is provided as the default set of
                # specificity and theme data for the rendering, using key names like 'before_0' to indicate that a certain
                # sub-array should be inserted at the very start of the array provided by getPageCSS().
                #
                # this would properly configure the 'specificity' and 'theme' settings for end-users,
                # who are (or are not) allowed by NicerApp to override the theme settings
                # that an author of a post has chosen.

                # in the case of someone commenting on another person's post,
                # the value for 'someApp_param_1_keyName' in a post's record
                # becomes the value for 'commentID' in a comment's record instead.


        #
        # this allows for a very limited amout of '{$myDomainName}___views' table records to be used
        # for very large amounts of dataIDs, without maintenance to the view rendering sub-system of NicerApp
        # leading to much downtime at all.
        # things like rendering a specific 'post' with newly created view processing code become easily possible.
        #
        # [1]   in a very efficient way, with amazingly fast binary-tree calculations
        #       happening basically inside the server's CPU,
        #       because the database is running on the same hardware as the webserver.
        #
        # [2]   this is true for all couchdb, filesystemDB and SQL database business logic within NicerApp.
        #
        # [3]   which is in the case of a JSON database
        #       (or in the case of a JSON database hosted on a SQL database server)
        #       a 'record', known in programming languages as a 'recursive array' or 'data object'.
