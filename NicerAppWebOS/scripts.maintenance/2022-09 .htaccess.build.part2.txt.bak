        # it's not a facebook post, and it's not a forum thread either. not even a nested forum thread.
        # it's just data ranging from tweet sized to gigabytes sized,
        # that's gotta get edited very efficiently
        # and displayed fast and correctly each time,
        # in a very, eh, diverse range of circumstances.
        #
        # NicerApp again works in a very simple way,
        # with one 'dataID' pointing to all content and data related to a 'post',
        # as structured (recently or not) by it's author and the 'commenters' to that 'post'.
        # (to speak in facebook terminology, for lack of a better set of analogies).
        #       i could start speaking in my own marketing choice terminology about my products and services,
        #       but i'd really like to avoid that and help create an industry standard of at least
        #       what to call things that one posts or says online.
        #
        # a dataID is formed inside the server (at random) upon creation of the 'post',
        # (or photo-album, or entire 3D world filled with people and data, or whatever),
        # trying low counts of random characters first each time,
        # and then slowly increasing the number of characters used to create a new dataID
        # when what's being tried is again already found in the database on the server.
        #
        # a dataID points to a JSON record containing not just theme settings for new viewers
        # to that post's data, along with possibly also *other* dataIDs,
        # which often leads NicerApp to possibly pull in content from there as well[1],
        # to arrive at a final 2D and/or 3D view in the browser.
        #
        # a dataID is stored in a database table[2] with the table name '{$myDomainName}___dataIDs'
        # that stores JSON records / recursive arrays / data objects / etc with each record having an
        # 'id' field containing a value that's got to match the dataID
        # to produce anything besides an error message on the screen.
        #
        # the forementioned (recursively-)structured index data ('what does this dataID point to?')
        # is listed in a field value for a field with name 'viewParameters_initial',
        #
        # the theme settings are listed in a field with name 'viewParameters_author_chosen_theme',
        #
        # along with a vpID pointing to a record in the '{$myDomainName}___viewProcessors' table,
        # with an 'id' value set to the vpID, and a record contents
        # that is structured like a piece of JSON directly derived from
        # .../domainConfig/nicer.app/mainmenu.items.php:$na_apps_structure[...]['apps-current']['NicerApp-WebOS__pageSettings'],
        #
        # to load up the right settings and display the requested content
        # via the right computer code when a person wants to view the data in some way.
        #
        # the record contents for vpIDs is also listed in the /*--all other pages--*/ section of this file you're reading now,
        # as encode_base64_url(json_encode(vpRecord)) encoded data.
        #
        # [1] (in a very efficient way, with amazingly fast binary-tree calculations
        #       happening basically inside the server's CPU,
        #       because the database is running on the same hardware as the webserver).
        #
        # [2] this is true for all couchdb, filesystemDB and SQL database business logic within NicerApp.
