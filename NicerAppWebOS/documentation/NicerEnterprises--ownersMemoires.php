    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="backdropped">
        I've never read other people's memoires, so I don't know what usually is included in one.<br/>
        But I bet a lot of people open with some kind of statement about their truthfulness in that document about themselves.<br/>
        The main problem with that is that humanity holds a lot of skilled liars right now ;-)<br/>
        So I'm just going to let the historians decide about what I tell you here.<br/>
    </p>

    <p class="backdropped">
        DISCLAIMER: Some of this stuff, I can't confirm to be the truth. It's guess-work. But I'll let you know in this short testimony book what I'm fairly sure about too.
    </p>

    <h2>Early youth</h2>
    <p class="backdropped">
        While still locked away in the crib as a todler kid barely able to walk, I learned to climb over the crib's wooden walls, and down the stairs to the candy cupboard ;-)<br/>
        Don't worry, I never stole much. I am more of an explorer than a thief, in reality, and to this day.<br/>
        That's my earliest memory.<br/>
    </p>

    <p class="backdropped">
        More to follow soon.
