Said.By/myNickname : Proposed Terms and Conditions

Failure to comply will result in the immediate and permanent cancellation of your abilities to make use of this platform (to be called "Website" after this), except for the purposes of reviewing and/or downloading your own works.

You will provide a digital copy of the face side of your valid ID before being able to have the public see files, media albums and documents that you host on this Website.
This needed for the Website operator to stay compliant with the law.
I require from you :
1 face-sided copy of your photo ID.
Several selfie videos of you, as requested by this Website, which can be taken from the chrome browser on any smartphone as well.

You will not impersonate anyone or any group, organisation, foundation, non-profit, non-state actors, or company, not with your actual ID and not with any of your "nickname IDs" that you can create on this Website.

You are allowed to export your data at any time of your choosing, or have it emailed to you at a regular interval (a feature which is to be made available before Dec 1st, 2028).

There is no real "Delete Content" feature on this Website. All that can be done is to hide posted content from the general public. It will remain available to law enforcement and said.by moderators and owners.

If needed, the same "Content Collections" that posts and media files can be posted into (as singular Threads of 1 Post followed by potentially many Comments), can be used to shield (an) audience(s) from such a Content Collection.

You will not engage in any breaches of Freedom of Speech or any other laws that apply to any of the jurisdictions that govern your audience(s).
You will not offer people money or prizes or investment advice geared to your own investment company/firm/etc on this platform.
I kindly refer you to my business news segment for that.
It will have an ability to comment on the news as soon as the Comments and "uDB" (Universal Database) modules are done.
